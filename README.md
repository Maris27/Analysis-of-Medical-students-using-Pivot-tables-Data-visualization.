# INTRODUCTION TO PIVOT TABLES
 In week two (2) we were introduced to pivot table.

 Pivot table is a powerful data analysis tool that enables us summarize,analyze and manipulate large data sets quickly and easily.we were also taught how pivot table works using an already existing data set used in week 1.After the session we were given tasks to analyze the medical students data sets which is displayed below.

# MEDICAL STUDENT DATA SET
Before answering the questions from the task,i had to clean the data by filling out the blank spaces using the average value from the numerical fields while i filled others using the value that suit me in other to answer my questions seamlessly.

# QUESTIONS
1. We were asked to create pivot tables which displays the average values of (Age,BMI,Temperature,Heart rate,Blood pressure and chlolesterol)for Both male and female students.
2. To display the Average heights and weights for both Genders in 2 decimal places.
3. Displaying the number of students across the different Blood Groups
4. Analyse students who smokes and those who dont
5. Display the number of students who have diabetes and those who dont.

1. After cleaning my data, i highlighted my data set using ctrl+ A on my keyboard then clicked on insert pivot table on insert tab,and i was requested to choose where i would want the pivot table either on a new worksheet or in an existing sheet,i clicked on create pivot table on a new sheet since i don't have an already exisiting sheet. After clicking on the new sheet it takes me to a new page as shown below.

then to get the average values i clicked on the left side of the worksheet where i have the pivot table1 and it displayed the pivot table fields on the right side of my worksheet, then i dragged the gender down to where i have row, then i also dragged the numeric values that is to be summarized down to the value fields then right clicked to change the value field from sum to average,so it can calculate the average values for each of the parameters.

2. To have my tables on one worksheet i highlighted my main data set and this time i clicked on create pivot table on an existing sheet ,then i clicked the pivot sheet i created and enter the cell range i want it to be created.
To get answers to question 2 I used the same approached from answering question 1, in ths case i was tasked to calculate the average height and weight of all students so i simply dragged the gender to the row field and also dragged the weight and height to the value field ,because they have numerical values,then i changed the value field from sum to average after getting the average values i decreased the decimal to two decimal places by clicking on decimal under Number column on the Home page.

3.Approaching question 3 i followed same step from question 2 to create the pivot table on an existing sheet, and to answer the questions i dragged the blood groups as displayed on the pivot table fields down to the row so i can have them well arranged, then i dragged the student's gender down to the value field but in this case i right clicked and changed the value field to count ,so it can count the total number of students across the different blood groups as shown above.

4. I used same approach from question 3 for answering this, the difference was in this case i was tasked to analyze students that smoke and those that dont, so i dragged smoking to the row field so my YES/NO options can drop below it,then i also dragged the gender down to the value field and changed the value field to count so the number of student that smoke and those that dont can be summarized.

5.I also used same approach for question 3 and 4 to answer this , but in this case i analysed students that have diabetes and those that dont.






# DATA VISUALIZATION

After the pivot table sessions ,we had an interesting session which is  data visualization. Data visualization is an essential part of data analysis and communication because it allows users to quickly understand trends,patterns and insights.It actually makes our analysis easy to interpret. After the session we were tasked to visualize our insights from the pivot tables above i.e question 2-4.


# ACTIVITIES

On my pivot table sheet I clicked on a cell within question 2, then clicked on pivot table analyse and select the  pivot chart ,then the next action was to select the chart I needed for the Job. choosing a suitable chart makes your analysis easy to understand So for this,i selected the column chart from the dropdowns. After selecting i copied it by right clicking and moved to a fresh worksheet for proper editing and viewing.
In editing i removed some distractions that wasnt needed. 
Followed the same procedure for Chart 3, 4 and 5.
